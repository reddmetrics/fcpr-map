                    The Forest Conservation Performance Rating (fCPR)
                    is a system of color-coded ratings for tropical
                    forest conservation performance that can be
                    implemented for local areas, countries, regions,
                    and the entire pan-tropics. The ratings reward
                    tropical forest conservation in three dimensions:
                    (1) exceeding expectations, given an area's forest
                    clearing history and development status; (2)
                    meeting or exceeding global REDD+ goals; and (3)
                    achieving an immediate reduction in forest
                    clearing.
                    <br><br>
                    Green ratings are assigned to areas that meet
                    condition (2); yellow to areas that meet (1) only;
                    and red to countries that fail to meet either
                    condition. We have developed fCPR at the Center
                    for Global Development (CGD), using monthly forest
                    clearing indicators from CGD's FORMA (Forest
                    Monitoring for Action). This first release rates
                    the quarterly conservation performance of 27
                    countries currently tracked by FORMA, as well as
                    242 of their states and provinces that contain
                    tropical forests. The 27 countries accounted for
                    94 percent of tropical forest clearing during the
                    period 2000-2005. Future releases will include
                    additional countries as FORMA begins tracking
                    them.
